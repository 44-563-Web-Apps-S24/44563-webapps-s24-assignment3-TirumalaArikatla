        <h3>Code Display</h3>
        <p>The code includes two functions, func1 and func2, printing different messages. In the main function, a constant someValue is set to 3, and a ternary operator is used to call either func1 or func2 based on the condition. This illustrates a succinct method for choosing and executing functions conditionally</p>
        <pre>
            void func1(){
                print("func 1 called");
               }
               
               void func2(){
                print("func 2 called");
               }
               
               void main() {
                const someValue = 3;
                (someValue == 4? func1 : func2)();
               }
        </pre>
